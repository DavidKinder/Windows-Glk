# Windows Glk

This is a Windows implementation of Andrew Plotkin's [Glk](https://eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html) library specification, an attempt to define a portable API for text adventures, and more generally, any program with primarily textual input and output.

In order to produce a useable program, the Glk library is combined with some sort of text adventure player (such as [Glulxe](https://github.com/erkyrath/glulxe) or [Git](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Git)):
