/* These constants define the classes of opaque objects. It's a bit ugly
    to put them in this header file, since more classes may be added in
    the future. But if you find yourself stuck with an obsolete version
    of this file, adding new class definitions will be easy enough -- 
    they will be numbered sequentially, and the numeric constants can be 
    found in the Glk specification. */
