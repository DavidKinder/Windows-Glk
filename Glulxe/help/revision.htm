<h1>Revision History</h1>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.4 (Windows Glk 1.48)</b>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the Gargoyle Glk extension functions that allow text formatting to be
changed dynamically, beyond what is allowed by the standard Glk style model.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.4 (Windows Glk 1.47)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.5.4, which includes a <a href="debug.htm">debugger</a>,
and also expands the work-around for games created with old versions of the Superglus
system to cover more game files.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.5, which adds character input to graphics windows, clarifies
the behaviour of zero-size windows, and specifies the encoding of Unicode text files as UTF-8.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.3 (Windows Glk 1.46)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.5.3, which includes some performance improvements.
<li>Glulxe 0.5.3 also includes a new compile-time option, which has been turned on for
Windows Glulxe, to tolerate a bug in old versions of the Superglus system that produced
game files that  would try to write to memory address zero. As a result, the
"Glulxe (no memory checks).exe" executable is no longer needed and has been removed.
<li>A new configuration file option, "FontFile", allows the game's font to be loaded from
a font file in the same directory as the game.
<li>Some of the Unicode characters above $1000 (that is, those in the Supplementary Multilingual
Plane) can now be output, provided that an appropriate font is available.
<li>Unicode text files are now encoded as UTF-8, as specified in the latest draft of the Glk
0.7.5 specification.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.2 (Windows Glk 1.45)</b>
<ul>
<li>The way in which colours are specified in the options dialog has been simplified: the
"General" tab now contains three buttons that allow the overall text, background and hyperlink
colours to be specified. Text and background colours are no longer specified in the "Styles"
tab on a per-style basis.
<li>The function glk_window_get_arrangement() no longer causes a crash if any of its output
arguments are 0.
<li>Added acceleration functions 8 through 13, which work correctly when the Inform 6 compiler
setting NUM_ATTR_BYTES is changed.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.1 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.5.1, which fixes a bug in reading from Glk streams.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.5.0 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.5.0, which fixes various bugs, and introduces new checks on the areas of
memory that the game reads and writes to. This causes problems with some games written with the
Superglus system: if this is a problem for you, a separate executable without these checks is
provided as "Glulxe (no memory checks).exe".
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.7 (Windows Glk 1.44)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.4, which introduces resource streams (i.e. access to
read-only data held in the Blorb game file).
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.7 (Windows Glk 1.43)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.7, which fixes various bugs.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.3, which includes more control when playing sounds.
This revision of the Glk specification also now specifies the meaning of the volume argument to
sound related Glk calls: as a result the handling of the volume has been changed to match the
specification.
<li>[More] prompts now function even if the game has exited, allowing any
long amount of final text to be read.
<li>Fixed a bug with file streams when reading and writing to the same file.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.6 (Windows Glk 1.42)</b>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the time returned by glk_current_time() has been improved. Providing that the
computer supports a sufficiently high resolution timer, the returned time is now correct to the
nearest microsecond.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.6 (Windows Glk 1.41)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.2, which includes functions for accessing the system's date and time.
<li>Updated to support Glk 0.7.1, which includes functions for Unicode string decomposition and
normalization, and control over line input echoing and terminator characters.
<li>Unicode characters now appear correctly in the scrollback dialog, provided that the dialog
font supports them.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.6 (Windows Glk 1.40)</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected problems with formatting and line input when margin images are present.
<li>Corrected a mistake in the handling of alpha-blended images.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.6 (Windows Glk 1.39)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.6, which implements the Glulx 3.1.2 specification.
This adds support for floating point calculations (that is, non-integer numbers).
<li>The window can be made to fill the entire screen; press <b>Alt+Enter</b> to toggle
this full screen mode on and off.
<li>A new configuration file option, "FullScreen", also makes the window fill the entire screen.
<li>During line input, Ctrl+Left moves the cursor to the start of the current word, and Ctrl+Right
moves to the end.
<li>The logic when scaling alpha-blended images has been improved, so there should no longer be
artifacts round the edges of such images.
<li>Data being written to files is now flushed whenever input is requested from the user.
This allows, for example, transcript files to update as a game is being played, and not only
when the interpreter closes the file.
<li>Corrected a problem which could result in the options dialog using the wrong font.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.5 (Windows Glk 1.38)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a file creation bug in glk_stream_open_file().
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.5 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.5, which fixes various obscure bugs that have been revealed by
unit-testing.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.4 (Windows Glk 1.37)</b>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on a Glk window now only shifts the keyboard input focus to that window if the
window is capable of text input: this means that after clicking on a graphics window, text can
still be input in a text buffer window without having to click back to the text buffer window.
<li>The implementation of the algorithm for scaling images has been sped up again.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.4 (Windows Glk 1.36)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.4, which implements the Glulx 3.1.1 specification.
This adds support for Inform 6 veneer acceleration, which can greatly increase
the performance of games compiled to take advantage of this.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.3 (Windows Glk 1.36)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug with glk_stylehint_clear() ignoring any user set values.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.3 (Windows Glk 1.35)</b>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of the algorithm for scaling images has been sped up.
<li>When the user tries to enter an input line wider than the window, the input is split
over multiple lines.
<li>Fixed a bug with sound volumes not being set correctly if the main window was
not yet open.
<li>Fixed a bug with the scrollback dialog not appearing when a translation DLL was in use. 
<li>Fixed another bug that occasionally led to a [More] prompt not appearing when it should.
<li>The C compiler used to compile Glulxe has been changed to GCC, resulting in an increase
in the speed of the interpreter.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.3 (Windows Glk 1.34)</b>
<ul>
<li>Improved the logic used to output Unicode text: now if a character can be drawn in
any font on the system, that font will be used where needed. For best results a 'Unicode'
font (e.g. "Arial Unicode MS" or "Code 2000") should be installed, though it doesn't need
to be selected as either the proportional or fixed width font.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.3 (Windows Glk 1.33)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that occasionally led to a [More] prompt not appearing when it should.
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an initial carriage return printed in a text buffer window to be
ignored.
<li>Rewrote the speech support to use SAPI 5, which comes with Windows XP and later.
<li>Speech options are now set in a separate "Speech" tab on the options dialog.
<li>Pressing the Break key (Ctrl+Pause) stops any currently playing speech.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.3 (Windows Glk 1.32)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.3, which fixes several bugs in 0.4.2.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.2 (Windows Glk 1.32)</b>
<ul>
<li>Added the menu item <b>About This Game</b> which, when playing an appropriately packaged
Blorb file, shows a dialog with the cover art and description of the game. This dialog is also
shown the first time a game is played.
<li>Added an option to say whether, for a game with an iFiction record, the <b>About This Game</b>
dialog is never shown, only shown the first time a game is loaded, or shown every time.
<li>Updated to the latest version of ModPlug, which is now compiled into the library.
<li>glk_fileref_create_by_name() now removes directory separator characters from its file name
argument, replacing them with dashes.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.2 (Windows Glk 1.31)</b>
<ul>
<li>Minor improvements to the interpreter's appearance under Windows Vista.
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug in glk_window_set_arrangement() when changing the direction
of the window sizing constraint.
<li>Fixed the incorrect clipping of italic text.
<li>Pressing a key in any window will now clear any pending [More] prompts in any other windows,
rather than requiring the user to select the affected window.
<li>Changed the default values of a few options: window borders are now off by default, and the
default indentation in text buffer windows is one unit, rather than zero.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.1 (Windows Glk 1.30)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.1, which implements the Glulx 3.1.0 specification.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.4.0 (Windows Glk 1.30)</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Glulxe 0.4.0, which implements the Glulx 3.0.0 specification.
<li>Updated to Glk 0.7.0, which adds Unicode support.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.27)</b>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Ogg Vorbis music resources, based on code submitted by David Moreno.
<li>The file extensions <b>.blorb</b>, <b>.glb</b> and <b>.gblorb</b> can be used for Blorb
files. The latter two indicate that the Blorb file contains a Glulx game.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.26)</b>
<ul>
<li>The input caret is now correctly restored after a save or restore file dialog.
<li>The mouse cursor now changes to the correct image over hyperlinks when a translation
DLL is in use.
<li>Pressing Ctrl+V with the focus on a text buffer window that is waiting for input now
pastes the contents of the clipboard into the input line.
<li>The WindowWidth and WindowHeight keys in a configuration file now refer to the size of
a single, full-size Glk window, rather than the entire window of the interpreter.
<li>The WindowMask key in a configuration file now only takes effect if the WindowFrame
key is set to "no".
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.25)</b>
<ul>
<li>Images are now scaled with a bilinear filter, resulting in greatly improved appearance
of scaled images.
<li>When the interpreter is started, it attempts to load a Blorb file with the same name as
the executable, so that you can rename the interpreter Foo.exe, distribute it with your game
Foo.blb, and have the user start the game simply by starting Foo.exe.
<li>Added true colour icons drawn by Javier San José.
<li>Added this help file.
<li>If a configuration file is loaded that specifies a window size, whether or not the window
was previously maximized is now ignored: the window always appears with the specified size.
<li>Images in the left or right margins of text buffer windows are now displayed correctly
after a flow break.
<li>The AIFF decoder now correctly handles chunks that are an odd number of bytes long.
<li>Text grid windows in which the game asks for input don't now steal the focus from text
buffer windows in which the game is also asking for input.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.24)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a serious resource leak under Windows 95/98/Me.
<li>Pressing the Pause key causes any windows blocking on a [More] prompt to update,
regardless of whether or not they are the active window.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.23)</b>
<ul>
<li>The speed at which the text to speech output is spoken can now be set from the options dialog.
<li>The scrollback dialog now opens at the end of the text, not the start.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.22)</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the annoying cursor flickering visible when games request timer events
faster than about 100ms.
<li>Added support for SONG music resources. The SONG format is essentially the same as MOD,
only with the music samples stored as separate AIFF sample resources.
<li>Added an Italian translation, by Tommaso Caldarola.
<li>Updated to use the new look GUI elements under Windows XP.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.21)</b>
<ul>
<li>Added a Spanish translation, by Javier San José.
<li>The scrollback buffer is no longer emptied when a text buffer window is cleared.
<li>Added support for configuration files, which allow various properties of the
interpreter's window to be set.
<li>Now using the latest version of MODPlug's mppsdk.dll.
<li>Fixed a problem with the speech routines excluding accented characters.
</ul>

<b>Glulxe 0.3.5 (Windows Glk 1.20)</b>
<ul>
<li>Completely rewrote the sound code to use DirectSound directly.
<li>The text printed in text buffer windows can now be spoken using Microsoft's
Speech Engine.
<li>Fixed the graphics scaling to produce better results.
<li>Fixed a bug which caused glk_fileref_does_file_exist() to not return a useful
result when called by a game.
<li>Calling glk_stream_open_file(filemode_ReadWrite) will now create the file
if it does not already exist.
<li>The current style for a window is now set to its previous value after line input,
rather than reverting to style_Normal.
</ul>
